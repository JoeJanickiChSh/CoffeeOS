# CoffeeOS

A simple os
It has this issue where the screen flashes when you actually boot it

## Recent Changes

- Fixed screen flashing. This was caused by a bit that was accidentally set in each character's background color that made the charaters flash
- Added text editor

## Todo

- Seperate into multiple C files instead if just headers
